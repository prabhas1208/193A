    <h4>Positions in Volleyball</h4>
    <p><strong>Setters</strong> have the task for orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents' court for a point.</p>
<p><strong>Liberos</strong> are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve.</p>  
<p><strong>Middle hitters</strong>, or <strong>middle blockers</strong>, are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually take place near the setter.</p>
<p><strong>Outside hitters</strong>, or <strong>left-side hitters</strong>, attack from near the left antenna. The outside hitter is usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets.</p>
<p><strong>Opposite hitters</strong>, or <strong>right-side hitters</strong>, carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in the front row. Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well-formed block against the opponents' Outside hitters and serve as a backup setter.</p>

      <p><strong>Volleyball</strong>, game played by two teams, usually of <strong>six</strong> players on a side,<br> in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a<br> high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents’<br> playing area before it can be returned. To prevent this a player on the<br> opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches<br> the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net<br> or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is<br> allowed only <strong>three</strong> touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.</p>
